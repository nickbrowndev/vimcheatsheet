# vimcheatsheet

A dynamically built cheatsheet for Vim/Neovim commands. The main issues I have found with the cheatsheets that I have
come across are:
 - Keybinding listed before description. I typically want to find out _how_ to do something, so scanning the text is the
 the main part
 - Alternative methods listed for different modes. Most of the keybindings are only useful in one mode, so knowing how 
 to do the same thing in different modes helps avoid unnecessary switching.

 Feel free to use it if you like. I only have keys in here currently for my setup and plugins.
